## About :information_source:
 
This project was developed in Rocketseat's Bootcamp GoStack 2019 to study React with Redux and Redux Saga. It simulates a Shoe e-commerce, implementing the Shop Cart feature. Basically, you can add and remove items from your cart. The information is storage in the Redux global state, and it's all manipulated using Redux actions and Saga middlewares.

## Libraries :books:

- **ReactJS** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux** - A global state management library. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- **Redux Saga** - A library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

## Tools :wrench:

- **Reactotron** - is a macOS, Windows, and Linux app for inspecting your React JS and React Native apps.
- **Json Server** - fake server, runs a fake API using a JSON file.

## Getting Started :rocket:

1. First, you'll have to run `yarn` to install project dependecies.
2. Run `yarn run-server` to start JSON SERVER and run the Fake API.
3. Run `yarn start`to run the application in development mode.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Remarks :pencil2:

- This project was developed in 2019, and didn't receive feature updates since 2019 (just `README` updates and a custom script in package.json).
- It is not using React Hooks API yet, it still implements class components.
